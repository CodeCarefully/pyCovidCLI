# pyCovidCLI
Everyone has a covid app. I made one to play with GoLang, 
and now I'm making one in python. 

This is pretty much a silly fun project, somewhat based on my 
[earlier work](https://github.com/CodeCarefully/myCOVIDcli) 

### ToDo:

* Make into a PIP Package?
* Use argparse to handle things like url, caching, debug, output formats etc..
* Handle fail cases better
* Tests
